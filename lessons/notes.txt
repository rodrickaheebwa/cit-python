Always include docstrings in your functions, which includes a description and an example output of the function.

Functions that operate on other functions are called "higher-order functions."

Python can add booleans with True as 1 and False as 0

By storing the data for a program in a different place than the code, you can make your programs easier for others to use and more resistant to bugs.

Always use zip form to send any files you wish to send over the Internet; whether mail..

When writing programs that handle files, it’s a good idea to comment out the code that does the actual copy/move/rename/delete and add a print() call instead so you can run the program and verify exactly what it will do.

"Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data, and 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data."
