# modules

# it is important to use "if __name__ == '__main__'" in your programs

# create a python virtual environment before downloading modules; in case projects differ in the versions of a module they will use.
# seperate the dependencies of one project from the dependencies of another
# the python version and module versions can't be changed there after
# python -m venv venv
# .\venv\Scripts\activate
# the virtual environment is created in that project folder
