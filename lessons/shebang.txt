The first line of all your Python programs should be a shebang line, which tells your computer that you want Python to execute this program. The shebang line begins with #!, but the rest depends on your operating system.

•	 On Windows, the shebang line is #! python3.
•	 On OS X, the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/env python3.
•	 On Linux, the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/python3.


To make it convenient to run your Python program, create a .bat batch file for running the Python program with py.exe.
To make a batch file, make a new text file containing a single line like the following:

		@py.exe C:\path\to\your\pythonScript.py %*

Replace this path with the absolute path to your own program, and save this file with a .bat file extension.
This batch file will keep you from having to type the full absolute path for the python program every time you want to run it.
I recommend you place all your batch and .py files in a single folder, such as 
C:\MyPythonScripts or C:\Users\YourName\PythonScripts

The C:\MyPythonScripts folder should be added to the system path on Windows so that you can run the batch files in it from the Run dialog.
To do this, modify the PATH environment variable.
Click the Start button and type Edit environment variables for your account.
The Environment Variables window that appears will look like Figure B-1.
From System variables, select the Path variable and click Edit.
In the Value text field, append a semicolon, type C:\MyPythonScripts, and then click OK.
Now you can run any Python script in the C:\MyPythonScripts folder by simply pressing win-R and entering the script’s name. 

Running pythonScript, for instance, will run pythonScript.bat, which in turn will save you from having to run the whole command
	py.exe C:\MyPythonScripts\pythonScript.py
from the Run dialog.
